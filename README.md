NoBuildPlus has provided different flags to protect your world. With simple and customizable settings,
you are able to manage the world easily
- Simple configuration to manage the certain worlds
- Available to change the managed items, blocks or mobs for the flag
- Able to change the boolean of different flags in global settings file
- Permissions and deny message are able to be adjusted or removed for each world
- GUI in game supported! More convenient way to enjoy the plugin
- Description of flags on [Wiki](https://github.com/Ez4p1xEL/NoBuildPlus/wiki).

NoBuildPlus is an open-source project which is created by a junior programmer.  
  
This plugin should be used on Spigot or Paper server or any based on Bukkit API.  
I highly recommend you to use it on higher minecraft version.
